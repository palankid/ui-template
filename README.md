# Maintenance

To start developing, run the following command:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with the valid credentials.

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

# Sync

To sync the cloned repository with the remote repository, run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn sync
```

## Partytown Script

Add the type="text/partytown" prop for each script that should run from a web worker. The example below is using the React specific way of inlining a script with dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

```
<script
  type="text/partytown"
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: '/* Inlined Third-Party Script */',
  }}
/>
```

## Storybook

There are two ways to run your storybook:

- `yarn storybook` to run the storybook

- `yarn storybook:build` to build the storybook

## Testing

There are two ways to test your application:

- `yarn test` to run the tests

- `yarn test:watch` to run the tests in watch mode

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: Wiring between storybook and Jest is done, check out the example `tests/pages/home.test.tsx` for more information.

## Running the app

There are multiple scripts ready to use on your first tryout.

- `yarn start` to launch the development server
- `yarn build` to build production
- `yarn lint` to run the linter

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ `yarn install` will trigger `.scripts/postinstall.js` script. Which contains important checks on whether you need to update certain configurations. It is strongly advised to make sure that script doesnâ€™t throw any warnings, or in case of the warning, resolve them ASAP before going live.
